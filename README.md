# Morph-To-Skeleton-Plugin

Morph targets only affect the vertices of a skeletal mesh, however, they do not affect the skeleton.
This actor component will calculate the power of a morph target, which vertices are being moved, and how those vertices are weighted against the skeleton in order to adjust the skeleton to fit the morph targets.

This plugin is a WIP!!!
